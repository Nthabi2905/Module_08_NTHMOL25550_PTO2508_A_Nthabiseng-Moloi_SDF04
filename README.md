### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **responsive design** and **adaptive layouts**.  
I practiced using **relative units** like `rem`, `%`, and `vh/vw` for more fluid scaling.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    padding: 1.5rem;
  }
}
```
